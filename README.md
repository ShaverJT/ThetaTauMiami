# The Website for Theta Tau - Miami University Colony

## Requirements

This website runs on Django and so it requires 

* Python 2.7
* Django 1.6
* dj_static
* dj_database
* django-htmlmin

If you are running this locally on a Unix-based machine (Linux, Mac OS X) these can be installed via pip

Run the following command at the shell

    sudo pip install django dj_database dj_static django-htmlmin
    
and the web app will be able to run locally.

If you are running locally on a Windows machine, you will still need to install each component.
Pip is available for Windows and should be able to install each of these components
